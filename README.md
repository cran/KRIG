KRIG
====

Implements different methods for spatial statistics, in particular focused in Kriging based models. We count with different implemented models, simple, ordinary and universal forms of Kriging, co-Kriging and regression Kriging models. Includes, multivariate sensitivity analysis under an approximation designed over Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and computation of Sobol indexes under this framework.
